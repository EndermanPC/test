Lithicsoft Trainer Studio 2024 Update Build 20240702.
Improved interface: We have worked a lot to improve the look and feel
compared to the previous version, we also have a separate logo for the
application.
Launcher already working: Launcher in the previous version had no
effect, now it checks and prepares the necessary files for the studio to 
work, including creating the necessary folders and downloading the 
files dependent.
Improved handling errors: We have added and supplemented the 
missing parts in handling errors, ensuring the best experience.
Improve performance: Eliminate and reorganize unnecessary code and
steps/algorithms to increase application performance.
App: We've made improvements to the way buttons and input bars
work, making sure everything works correctly.

Lithicsoft Trainer Studio 2024 Build 20240703
Launcher fix: Launcher showed the download/test process instead of
running it in the background. Launcher optimization.
Reported bug fixes: Text color error (black instead of blue), launcher
background color (white instead of blue), control panel, camera 
asymmetry error (not square), accuracy error in report tab (display
decimal numbers)
Use images instead of cameras: Users can now use images to predict
without having to use the camera.
Test mode: Test model in the result tab will be automatically enabled
when the model has been previously trained (with model.zip file) each
time it starts.
